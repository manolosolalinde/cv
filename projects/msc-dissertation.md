title: A Finite Element Based Level Set Approach for the Simulation of Two-Phased Flows
description: Master thesis dissertation. Level set approach for the simulation of two-phase immiscible newtonian ï¬‚uids. The model consists on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with an advection equation for the level set function. The so-called Continuum Surface Force approach (CSF) is used to model the effect of surface tension.
